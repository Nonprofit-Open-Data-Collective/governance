\usage{
get_scores(
  feature.matrix,
  missing = TRUE,
  impute = "median",
  scores.by.hand = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature.matrix}{A matrix containing responses to questions for organizations.
Output from \code{get_features} function.
Rows represent each organization, and must contain columns that represent responses
to the following questions:
"P12_LINE_1", "P4_LINE_12", "P4_LINE_28", "P4_LINE_29_30", "P6_LINE_1", "P6_LINE_11A",
"P6_LINE_15A", "P6_LINE_18", "P6_LINE_2", "P6_LINE_3", "P6_LINE_8A", "P6_LINE_12_13_14".
See \code{vignette("making-gov-scores", package = "governance")} for details on these features.}

\item{missing}{From psych::factor.scores. If missing is TRUE, missing items
are imputed using either the median or mean. If missing is FALSE, the default,
scores are found based upon the mean of the available items for each subject.
If missing is FALSE, input rows with NA values will not be included in the output.}

\item{scores.by.hand}{If FALSE, psych::factor.scores is used to calculate features scores.
If TRUE, manual calculations are used to calculate the factors scores. This option
should only be used if \code{features.matrix} has no missing values AND is not of full rank
(i.e. at least one column is all 0's or 1's).
See Appendix of See \code{vignette("making-gov-scores", package = "governance")} for
details on this calculation.}

\item{imput}{From psych::factor.scores. If missing == TRUE, then missing data
can be imputed using "median" or "mean". The number of missing by subject is
reported. If impute = "none", missing data are not scored.
Median is the default for our usage because all of our feature values are binary.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original \code{features.matrix} input data and
appended 6 factor scores along with a total score.
}
\description{
This function takes a data.frame of features appends 6 factor scores
along with a total score.
}
\details{
This function generates factor scores for observations in the input
\code{feature.matrix} from pre-loaded factor model ( in \code{data/factor-objects.Rdata})
}

# get data

dat_example <- dat_example[keep_rows, ]

# get features
features_example <- get_features(dat_example)

# get scores
scores_example <- get_scores(features_example)
